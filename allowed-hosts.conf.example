# Allowed Hosts Configuration
#
# This file lists hosts and ports that should be accessible from the Claude container.
# The network namespace with iptables will enforce these rules at the IP level.
#
# FORMAT:
#   hostname:port          - Allow specific host and port
#   hostname:port1,port2   - Allow specific host with multiple ports
#   hostname               - Allow host on common ports (80, 443)
#   IP.ADD.RE.SS:port      - Allow specific IP and port
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# SECURITY NOTE:
# This provides TRUE network filtering via iptables in a network namespace.
# Only connections to listed hosts/ports will be allowed.
# DNS queries (port 53) are allowed by default for name resolution.
#
