I want to use Claude safely with --dangerously-skip-permissions

I need a script that:
a) uses podman to setup a container
b) allows to run the container with claude

The container shall:
- be based on Debian Trixie. Give me a basic Containerfile
  and install claude in it
- mount $(pwd) readwrite at the same location. Also I need ~/git/ mounted
  readonly. When $(pwd) is inside ~/git/, I still need $(pwd) writable and
  the rest of ~/git/ readonly.
- Have internet access, but no access to the local network
- optionally no internet access at all
- network access to selected hosts/ports
